# üéôÔ∏è Urdu Voice Conversations ChatBot ü§ñ
 This Streamlit app enables users to have conversations in Urdu using voice input. The app captures the user's voice, converts it to Urdu text, generates a response in Urdu using Google Generative AI, and then converts the response back to speech for playback.

Key Features:

Voice Recognition: The app uses streamlit_mic_recorder to capture and convert the user's voice to Urdu text.

Urdu Language Model: The app integrates with Google's Gemini AI model (gemini-1.5-flash) to generate responses in Urdu, ensuring the assistant always replies in pure Urdu.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): The recognized text and AI-generated response are both converted into speech using Google's TTS service (gTTS), allowing users to hear the responses in Urdu.

User-Friendly Interface: The app provides a simple interface where users can speak in Urdu, view the recognized text, and listen to the AI's response.

This application is perfect for users who want to interact with an AI in Urdu through voice, offering a seamless and natural conversational experience.
